                            Before moving into software development, I worked as
                            a residential architect for five years, which has
                            helped me every day to communicate with clarity with
                            my teammates and contribute to the company with my
                            design sensibility.

                            As a pianist, music has always been an integral part
                            of my life. The habit of practicing and composing
                            pieces of music has taught me how to concentrate for
                            long hours and build a balanced and grounded
                            mindset.
