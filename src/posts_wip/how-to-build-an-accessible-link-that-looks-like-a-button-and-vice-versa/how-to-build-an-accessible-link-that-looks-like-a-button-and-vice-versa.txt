So many times, as a software developer, I have come across UI designs with links styled like buttons and buttons styled like links. But what is the most accessible way to implement them?

In this post I will describe what, I believe, is the best strategy for building hybrid links and buttons that look and behave correctly for accessibility and semantics.

## What is semantic HTML?

[Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) is the building foundation for creating web content that has a meaning. A meaning for search engines, designers, web developers and, most of all, users.

A blog should be inside an `<article>` tag, a hero title inside a `<h1>` tag and a set of navigation links inside a `<nav>` tag. You can find all available tags [here](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/default.asp).

This is how search engines decide which content best matches a certain request and how users navigate a web page trying to _anticipate_ what action a certain visual element is bounded to.

## When to use a button tag?

## When to use an anchor tag?

## Possible solutions

### 1. Choosing the tag based on HTML semantics

### 2. Choosing the tag based on UI design

### 3. Using the "role" attribute

## Conclusion
